I need to check what the current plan names are and update them to match your actual plans. Let me look at the subscription plans in the server configuration:


Opened server/routes.ts

Searched for "Find subscription plans configuration with plan names and pricing"
I can see that the current server configuration shows "Starter", "Professional", and "Enterprise" plans, but you're saying these don't match your actual plans. Could you tell me what the correct plan names should be?

Looking at the current configuration:

Current Plans:

Starter (basic) - €24.65/month, 3 users, 100 invoices
Professional (professional) - €41.65/month, 10 users, 500 invoices
Enterprise (business) - €75.65/month, 50 users, unlimited invoices
What should the correct plan names be? Please provide:

The correct names for each plan tier
Any pricing adjustments needed
Any feature/limit changes required
Once you provide the correct plan names, I'll update them throughout the entire application including:

Server configuration (routes.ts)
All frontend pages (subscribe, landing, compare-features, etc.)
Database schema if needed
Documentation
