- **Sessions**: Required for Replit Auth (connect-pg-simple)
- **Demo Requests**: Lead generation and sales pipeline
- **Subscription Plans**: Flexible pricing tiers with features

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions
- **User Management**: Automatic user creation and profile management
- **Authorization**: Route-level protection with authentication middleware

### Subscription Management
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe with webhook validation
- **Pricing Tiers**: Basic ($29), Professional ($79), Business ($159)
- **Features**: Tiered feature access based on subscription level
- **Billing**: Automated subscription lifecycle management

### Frontend Components
- **Landing Page**: Marketing site with demo request forms
- **Dashboard**: Authenticated user interface for business management
- **Subscription Flow**: Stripe Elements integration for payment processing
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints

### API Routes
- **Authentication**: User profile and session management
- **Subscriptions**: Stripe integration for plan management
- **Demo Requests**: Lead capture and management
- **Webhooks**: Stripe event processing for subscription updates

## Data Flow

### User Registration Flow
1. User authenticates via Replit Auth
2. Profile automatically created/updated in database
3. Redirect to dashboard or subscription selection
4. Stripe customer creation on subscription selection

### Subscription Flow
1. User selects pricing plan
2. Stripe Payment Intent created
3. Payment processed via Stripe Elements
4. Webhook updates user subscription status
5. Feature access granted based on plan tier

### Authentication Flow
1. Replit Auth handles OAuth flow
2. Session stored in PostgreSQL
3. User profile synchronized with auth provider
4. Protected routes check authentication status

## External Dependencies

### Core Infrastructure
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Replit Auth**: Authentication provider
- **Stripe**: Payment processing and subscription management

### Development Tools
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **ESBuild**: Production bundle optimization
- **Vite**: Development server and build system

### UI Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon system
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite production build with asset optimization
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundle with external packages
- **Database**: Drizzle schema push for migrations
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV-based configuration

### Environment Variables
- **Database**: `DATABASE_URL` for Neon connection
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth configuration
- **Payments**: Stripe public/secret keys and webhook secrets
- **Sessions**: Secure session secret for encryption

### Development Workflow
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript across frontend and backend
- **Database**: Development migrations with Drizzle Kit
- **API Development**: Express middleware with error handling

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types and utilities, enabling rapid development while maintaining type safety across the full stack. The architecture supports horizontal scaling through the serverless database and stateless API design with session-based authentication.
